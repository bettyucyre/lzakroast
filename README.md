# How to Get Unbanned on Lost Ark (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from Lost Ark can be a real pain, especially if you’re convinced it’s a big misunderstanding. No worries! This easy-to-follow guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and show you the best ways to appeal so you can get back to sailing those seas and battling demons.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned right after making a new Lost Ark account, or is the ban tagging along no matter what account you use? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Lost Ark has blacklisted your PC hardware, making it tricky to enjoy the game even with fresh accounts.
